## Getting Started

```sh
yarn install
```

## Notes

- At its most simplest, a React component is a function that returns an HTML element
- The React component function takes key-value pairs called 'props' — very similar to HTML attributes. However, the keys can be named whatever you like.
- React components can also render (return) other React components
- You can bundle up a lot of power in one React component —  multiple HTML elements for example
- Things nested inside a rendered component become accessible as the `children` prop
- React component can dynamically change what HTML tag it will use — e.g. use `<a>` when `href` prop is passed, otherwise use `<button>`
- String interpolation is great for punching prop values into class names


## Challenges

1. Add components for Alert
2. Add components for Card
3. Add components for Forms and Fields
